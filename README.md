# Toy Store Management System

## Overview
This project is a desktop application designed to simulate the operations of an online toy store. It provides a foundation for managing customers, products, and orders efficiently, preparing for the eventual transition to a full web-based system. Using key data structures and algorithms, the application ensures smooth handling of store operations and logistics.
